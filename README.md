# Raiku Traffic Warden 🚦

### Visual Simulation Blueprint — Raiku x Blockspace Management

**Goal:**  
Show how Raiku’s deterministic execution can manage blockspace like a traffic system — predictable, efficient, and fair.

---

## 🧠 Concept Overview

**Raiku Traffic Warden** is a **visual simulation and blueprint** demonstrating how Raiku’s slot reservation and deterministic execution could structure blockspace like real-world traffic management.

Instead of congested and unpredictable transactions, Raiku coordinates them like a “warden,” ensuring fair access and smooth flow.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Deterministic Slot Flow:** Visualizes Raiku’s slot scheduling as timed intersections.  
- **Predictable Execution:** Each transaction moves in an ordered lane — no collisions.  
- **Integration Blueprint:** Demonstrates how Raiku can plug into existing DEXs or NFT systems.  
- **Educational Layer:** Simple visuals to explain MEV mitigation and slot markets.
